(For example, in the below \"repeat\" block, the body contains the \"print\" block and its input.)  There are two types of control blocks: \nIfElse\n (described on their own page) and these, which control how many times the body is run and, in some cases, the value of a variable used within the body.  These structures are called \nloops\n since the body is repeated (possibly) multiple times, reminiscent of a rope containing loops.  Each pass through the loop is called an \niteration\n.  For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#Loops.\n\n\nBlocks for Loop Creation\n\n\nrepeat\n\n\nThe simplest \"repeat\" block runs the code in its body the specified number of times.  For example, the following block will print \"Hello!\" ten times.\n\n\n\n\nrepeat while\n\n\nImagine a game in which a player rolls a die and adds up all of the values rolled as long as the total is less than 30.  The following blocks implement that game:\n\n\n\n\nA variable named \ntotal\n gets an initial value of 0.\n\n\nThe loop begins with a check that \ntotal\n is less than 30.  If so, the blocks in the body are run.\n\n\nA random number in the range 1 to 6 is generated (simulating a die roll) and stored in a variable named \nroll\n.\n\n\nThe number rolled is printed.\n\n\nThe variable \ntotal\n gets increased by \nroll\n.\n\n\nThe end of the loop having been reached, control goes back to step 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the loop completes, any subsequent blocks (not shown) would be run.  In our example, the loop would end after some number of random numbers in the range 1 to 6 had been printed, and the variable \ntotal\n would hold the sum of these numbers, which would be guaranteed to be at least 30.\n\n\nFor more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop.\n\n\nrepeat until\n\n\n\"Repeat while\" loops repeat their bodies \nwhile\n some condition is true.  Repeat-until loops are similar except that they repeat their bodies \nuntil\n some condition is true.  The following blocks are equivalent to the previous example because the loop contains until \ntotal\n is greater than or equal to 30.\n\n\n\n\ncount with\n\n\nThe \ncount with\n block (called a \nfor loop\n in most programming languages) advances a variable from the first value to the second value by the increment amount (third value), running the body once for each value.  For example, the following program prints the numbers 1, 3, and 5.\n\n\n\n\nAs shown by the two following loops, each of which prints the numbers 5, 3, and 1, the first input may be larger than the second.  The behavior is the same whether the increment amount (third value) is positive or negative.\n\n\n\n\nfor each\n\n\nThe \nfor each\n block (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach) is similar, except instead of giving the loop variable values in a numeric sequence, it uses the values from a list in turn.  The following program prints each element of the list: \"alpha\", \"beta\", \"gamma\".\n\n\n\n\nLoop Termination Blocks\n\n\nMost loops run until the terminating condition (in the case of  \nrepeat\n blocks) is met or until all values have been taken by the loop variable (in the case of \ncount with\n and \nfor each\n loops).  Two rarely needed but occasionally useful blocks provide additional means for controlling loop behavior.  Although the below examples are for \nfor each\n loops, they can be used with any type of loop.\n\n\ncontinue with next iteration\n\n\nThe \ncontinue with next iteration\n (called \ncontinue\n in most programming languages) causes the remaining code in the body to be skipped and for the next iteration (pass) of the loop to begin.\n\n\nThe following program prints \"alpha\" on the first iteration of the loop.  On the second iteration, the \ncontinue with next iteration\n block is run, skipping the printing of \"beta\".  On the final iteration, \"gamma\" is printed.\n\n\n\n\nbreak out of loop\n\n\nThe \nbreak out of loop\n block provides \nan early exit from a loop\n.  The following program prints \"alpha\" on the first iteration and \"breaks out\" of the loop on the second iteration when the loop variable is equal to \"beta\".  The third item in the list is never reached.\n\n\n\n\nThis document has been based on the Blockly documentation under the same title by Neil Fraser released under \nCC BY 3.0",

This way it can be distributed without any dependencies other than having the Arduino IDE.\n\n\nThe application can be categorised in three main components: Python server, HTML/Javascript front end, and a desktop application wrapper.\n\n\nCurrently the Python server is packaged using py2exe for Windows, and PyInstaller for Linux and Mac OS X. In the future PyInstaller might be updated to also create the Windows builds, for now the original py2exe script is pretty stable.\n\n\nThe desktop wrapper is based on Electron, which uses node.js. The node.js component is only used where required for the application to integrate well with the individual desktop platforms. Originally the Chromium Embedded Framework Python bindings were used, but cross-platform maintenance proved to be problematic and Electron has provided a much smother alternative.\n\n\nBuild servers\n\n\nEach commit to the \nArdublockly GitHub repository\n triggers the build servers to follow all these build steps and upload the build output to an \nonline server\n to make them available for download.\n\n\nThere is a server for each platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux) with their own build script. So it could be useful to have a look at these scripts if some of the instructions here are not completely clear:\n\n\n\n\nWindows AppVeyor script: https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly/blob/master/.appveyor.yml\n\n\nmacOS Travis script: https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly/blob/master/.travis.yml\n\n\nLinux CircleCI script: https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly/blob/master/circle.yml\n\n\n\n\nArdublockly executable build dependencies\n\n\nGit\n\n\nGit needs to be installed on the system and accessible through the command line interface.\n\n\nPython\n\n\nThe build scripts included in the \npackage\n folder were originally developed and tested on Python 2.7, and later the build system was moved to use Python 3.4. Therefore, while these scripts should still be compatible with Python 2, on their current form they have only been tested on Python 3.\n\n\nWhile the \"core version\" of Ardublockly (command line server + browser-based GUI) should be fully compatible with both Python 2 and 3 (tested on Python 2.7 and 3.4), there is one particular step in this build process that requires Python 2.7.\n\n\nIf you are using Python virtual environments on Windows this \ncollection of Python extensions binaries\n is highly recommended.\n\n\nThe specific versions of the Python dependencies can be found in the \nrequirements.txt\n file.\n\n\npy2exe\n\n\npy2exe is a Distutils extension to build Python scripts into Windows executable programs.\n\n\nThis package is only required for the Windows build. The Linux and Mac OS X builds use the PyInstaller scripts included in this folder.\n\n\nYou can download py2exe from their \nofficial website\n.\n\n\nPyInstaller\n\n\nConverts (packages) Python programs into stand-alone executables, used for the Linux and Mac OS X builds.\n\n\nPyInstaller\n can be easily installed using pip:\n\n\n pip install pyinstaller\n\n\n\n\nMkDocs\n\n\nMkDocs\n is a static page generator specifically designed for documentation using Markdown.\n\n\nThe project documentation is written and hosted in the \nArdublockly GitHub Wiki\n. The build script for the documentation pulls its markdown files and converts them into an HTML static site for offline access.\n\n\nMore information about this procedure can be found on \nthis article\n.\n\n\nMkDocs can be easily installed using pip:\n\n\npip install MkDocs\n\n\n\n\nNode.js\n\n\nNode.js is required to run \nElectron\n. It can be downloaded from the \nofficial website\n.\n\n\nThe \nnpm\n package manager should be included with node, which is used to deal with all the Electron application dependencies.\n\n\nDownload the Source Code\n\n\nDownload and initialise this project repository:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly.git\ncd ardublockly\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\n\n\n\nIf you have already downloaded the Ardublockly source code, make sure the submodules are initialised, in this case the 'closure-library' in the project root directory, and 'ardublockly.wiki' in the 'package/ardublocklydocs/' folder. You can run the last git command above in the project root directory to ensure this is the case, otherwise the submodule directories will be empty.\n\n\nBuild Instructions\n\n\nFirst step: Blockly\n\n\nWhen Blockly is compiled, all the source code contained in the \nblockly\n folder is compressed in the \nblockly/blockly_compressed.js\n, \nblockly/blocks_compressed.js\n, and  \nblockly/arduino_compressed.js\n files (among others). The repository version of these compressed files might not be the most up-to-date, so the first step should be to compile Blockly to ensure the compressed files are up-to-date.  \n\n\nYou will need Python 2.7 for this step, as the Blockly build script is not currently compatible with Python 3. You will also need to be online, as the Google's \"Closure Compiler Service\" is used. From the project root directory:\n\n\ncd blockly\npython build.py\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, if continuing with the next steps, it is recommended to go back to the project root directory:\n\n\ncd ../\n\n\n\n\nSecond step: Python server (platform dependent)\n\n\nThe build steps for the Ardublockly Server are slightly different depending on the platform.\n\n\nWindows Build\n\n\nTo build Ardublockly under Windows all you have to do is execute the \nbuild_windows.py\n file from the project root directory:\n\n\npython package\\build_py2exe.py\n\n\n\n\nThis will remove any previous build directory, rebuild, and create the \nardublockly_run.bat\n file into the project root.\n\n\nLinux Build\n\n\nTo build Ardublockly under Linux all you have to do is execute the \nbuild_pyinstaller.py\n file from the project root directory:\n\n\npython package/build_pyinstaller.py\n\n\n\n\nThe optional command line argument \nlinux\n can be provided, but the operating systems should be automatically detected.\n\n\nThis will remove any previous build directory, rebuild, and create the \nardublockly_run.sh\n file into the project root.\n\n\nMac OS X Build\n\n\nTo build Ardublockly under Mac OS X all you have to do is execute the \nbuild_pyinstaller.py\n file from the project root directory:\n\n\npython package/build_pyinstaller.py\n\n\n\n\nThe optional command line argument \nmac\n can be provided, but the operating systems should be automatically detected.\n\n\nThis will remove any previous build directory, and rebuild it.\n\n\nThird step: Electron (platform independent)\n\n\nExecute the following commands from the project root directory:\n\n\ncd package\\electron\nnpm install\nnpm run release\n\n\n\n\nThe npm scripts will automatically detect and deal with the operating system different build requirements.\n\n\nAt this point, if continuing with the next steps, it is recommended to go back to the project root directory:\n\n\ncd ../../\n\n\n\n\nFourth step: Documentation (platform independent)\n\n\nBuild the offline documentation by running the \nbuild_docs.py\n script from the project root directory:\n\n\npython package\\build_docs.py\n\n\n\n\nThis will remove any previous build directory, rebuild it, and remove any temporary files.\n\n\nFinal Step: Packing all Ardublockly (platform independent)\n\n\nThis step is only meant if you wish to pack the Ardublockly application into a distributable form. You can pack Ardublockly running the following command from the project root directory:\n\n\npython package/pack_ardublockly.py\n\n\n\n\nThe pack script is designed for the build servers to zip the required contents into a single file to be uploaded to cloud storage, so it does not pack all the repository source code. This script creates a new folder on the same level a the project root, removes unnecessary files from this copied directory, and then zips it and saves it into the folder 'upload' within the original project root.",

Then, when the front end sends the code to be compiled, it check this saved setting and appends the relevant compiler flag to the IDE command line invocation.\n\n\nIt is important to ensure that the new key entry in this dictionary contains the same name as the new board profile added to \nblockly/generators/arduino/boards.js\n.\n\n\nAn example with a couple of items can be seen below, to add a new board, the same format entry has to be added to this dictionary.\n\n\n__arduino_types = {'Uno': 'arduino:avr:uno',\n                   'Leonardo': 'arduino:avr:leonardo'}\n\n\n\n\nBlockly update\n\n\nThe Arduino code generator contains a list of Arduino Board profiles defining board characteristics like the pin, peripheral configuration, compiler flag, etc.\n\n\nThe following is the board profile for the Arduino Uno, a similar profile will have to be created for the new board to support.

If you are using a web browser make sure you delete your cache and/or do a hard refresh, if using the desktop application you can achieve this by deleting the folder  appdata , located inside the  arduexec  folder.   Q: I've got an error message saying \"Error: Closure not found\".  A:  This could happen if you are trying to run or build the uncompressed version of Blockly and the  closure-library  folder hasn't been populated correctly. Make sure you have initialised all git submodules as indicated in the \"Download the Source Code\" section from the  Building Ardublockly  document.",

Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.\n\n\nUsing Creative Commons Public Licenses\n\n\nCreative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for licensors:\n Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. \nMore considerations for licensors\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for the public:\n By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor\u2019s permission is not necessary for any reason\u2013for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright\u2013then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. \nMore considerations for the public\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\n\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 \u2013 Definitions.\n\n\na. \nAdapted Material\n means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n\nb. \nAdapter's License\n means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nc. \nCopyright and Similar Rights\n means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nd. \nEffective Technological Measures\n means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n\n\ne. \nExceptions and Limitations\n means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n\nf. \nLicensed Material\n means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\n\ng. \nLicensed Rights\n means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n\nh. \nLicensor\n means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n\n\ni. \nShare\n means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n\n\nj. \nSui Generis Database Rights\n means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n\nk. \nYou\n means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 \u2013 Scope.\n\n\na. \nLicense grant.\n\n\n1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n\n    B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n5. __Downstream recipients.__\n\n    A. __Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n    B. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n\n\nb. \nOther rights.\n\n\n1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\n\nSection 3 \u2013 License Conditions.\n\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n\na. \nAttribution.\n\n\n1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n    A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n        i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\n        ii. a copyright notice;\n\n        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n        v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n    B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n\na. \nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n\n\nb. \nTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\n\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n\n1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\n\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\n\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the \u201cLicensor.\u201d Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at [creativecommons.org/policies](http://creativecommons.org/policies), Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark \u201cCreative Commons\u201d or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not form part of the public licenses.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at creativecommons.org\n\n\n\n\nDesktop Application Wrapper License\n\n\nThe original electron boilerplate by Jakub Szwacz is release under the following license.

Considerations for licensors:  Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright.  More considerations for licensors .    Considerations for the public:  By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor\u2019s permission is not necessary for any reason\u2013for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright\u2013then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
